      "A couple weeks ago, I made a small class to [create animated build figures for IPython presentations](http://melissagymrek.com/python/2013/12/13/ipython-presentations-build-figures.html). This a short addendum to that post, this time with animated tables instead of figures. These draw on th [formatted IPython tables](http://melissagymrek.com/python/2014/01/12/ipython-tables.html) that I posted yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea here is same with the figures: often when you are presenting a figure or table, using animation to slowly build it up helps you tell the story in a more organized way. Powerpoint is full of options to do this, but I would like to do it programatically in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of the animated tables is to make a widget that takes in a formatted table and a list of functions to apply to the table With each click, it applies the next function in succession. This is best illustrated with a short example:"
